# Heart-Disease-Analysis-and-visualization
This repo is about Heart Disease Analysis and Visualization using Python(scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy) to compare the Precison and Recall of each model. The dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci.

Utilized coordinate descent algorithm as the logistics solver, radial basis function as the kernel of SVM and the maximum depth of 4 of decision tree and random Forest to avoid overfitting and fulfilled 87.10%, 78.13%, 75.29%, 90.50% of Precision-Recall AUC
